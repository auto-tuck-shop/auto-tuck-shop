# Auto Tuck Shop — Copilot Instructions

## Start of every chat session

Before doing anything else, ask:

1. **Who is working?** — Brighton (tech lead) or Madrena (junior developer). Brighton gets concise technical responses. Madrena gets more explanation, especially around Git, PRs, and Django patterns she may not have seen before.
2. **What are we working on?** — ask for the GitHub issue number if there is one. Read the issue before starting work.

If the user's first message already makes it clear (e.g. "help me with issue #18"), skip what's already answered.

Django app. Shop owners in Zimbabwe send WhatsApp text or voice messages to record sales. The bot parses them with an LLM, creates sale records, and replies with a receipt.

## Stack

- Django 5 — backend
- WhatsApp Business API (Meta) — message intake at `apps/whatsapp/views.py`
- OpenRouter (Gemini 2.5 Flash) — LLM parsing at `services/openrouter/`
- ElevenLabs — voice transcription at `services/elevenlabs/`
- Cloudflare R2 — media storage at `services/storage/`
- Fly.io — hosting (staging + production)
- PostgreSQL — production database

## Key entry points

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `apps/whatsapp/views.py` | Webhook entry point |
| `apps/whatsapp/services/sale_handler.py` | Sale creation and button processing |
| `apps/whatsapp/services/waitlist_handler.py` | Onboarding and language selection |
| `apps/whatsapp/services/media_handler.py` | Audio download, transcription, R2 upload |
| `apps/whatsapp/services/message_parser.py` | LLM call and result parsing |
| `services/openrouter/prompts.py` | System prompt — tune this for parsing improvements |
| `apps/whatsapp/locales/` | `en.json` and `sn.json` — all user-facing strings |

## Current phase

Pilot prep. Code is ready. Not yet deployed to production. When suggesting tasks, prioritise items that directly enable the first live deploy — accounts, secrets, staging deploy, webhook registration.

## Team

- Brighton (@dev-thandabantu) — tech lead
- Madrena (@dev-mthandabantu) — junior developer
- Bradley (@bradleychibuwe105-coder) — field/business

## Rules

- Never edit existing migration files. Always create a new migration.
- Never commit `.env` files. Use environment variables.
- All changes go through a PR. No direct pushes to `main`.
- Staging deploy before production deploy, always.
- Production deploy requires Brighton's explicit sign-off.

## Language handling

Messages arrive in English, Shona, or mixed. The LLM handles parsing. Key Shona:
- `imwe` / `imwe neimwe` = "each" (per-unit price marker)
- `maviri`=2, `matatu`=3, `mana`=4, `mashanu`=5
- `ne` = "and" (joins items in a list)

Regression tests for Shona parsing: `unit_tests/test_shona_parsing.py`

## Testing

```bash
# Unit tests
python manage.py test unit_tests

# Staging integration tests (requires .env.staging with STAGING_URL)
python -m pytest tests/ -x
```
